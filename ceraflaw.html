        <h1>What is CeraFlaw</h1>
        <p>
            Ceraflaw is a sophisticated computer vision solution meticulously designed to identify visual flaws in ceramic tiles, including line cracks, surface irregularities, and broken corners.This initiative materialized through a collaborative effort, where I played dual roles as a full-stack developer and project manager, overseeing the entirety of the development life cycle.

            Technological Framework:

            In crafting the frontend, we leveraged Dart and Flutter to deliver a sleek and intuitive user interface. On the backend, Python was employed for its versatility and efficiency in managing complex tasks. Seamless communication between frontend and backend was achieved through Flask for API integration. Furthermore, to enhance the software's defect-detection capabilities, we integrated OpenCV and YOLOv8 libraries, ensuring precision and reliability.
